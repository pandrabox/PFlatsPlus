# Unity Settings
## Overview
- FlatsPlus can be customized in Unity.
- The easiest way is to first turn everything "Off" and then check only the features you need.
  - When you check a feature, other features may also be checked at the same time. These are necessary, so it is recommended not to uncheck them.
- There are also features that allow for more detailed settings, making it convenient to adjust for easier use.
