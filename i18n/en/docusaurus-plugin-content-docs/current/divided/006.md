# Uninstall
- Removing the FlatsPlus prefab from your avatar will remove almost all effects, but if you need to remove it more thoroughly, follow these steps:
- Delete the Assets/Pan/FlatsPlus folder.
  - If you created custom expressions, they are saved here, so please be careful.
- Open Manage Project in VCC.
  - Delete FlatsPlus and PandraVase.
